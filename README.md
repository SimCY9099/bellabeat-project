Data Cleaning and Visualization Project:
This repository contains the code and documentation for my Data Cleaning and Visualization Project, focusing on Bellabeat, 
a prominent smart device company. The project aims to leverage SQL and Tableau to analyze and visualize data, 
providing valuable insights and recommendations.

Project Overview:
Bellabeat is dedicated to empowering women with data-driven insights and offers wellness-oriented wearable devices. 
In this project, I utilized SQL and Tableau to clean, analyze, and visualize Bellabeat's data, 
with the goal of uncovering meaningful insights and providing actionable recommendations.
